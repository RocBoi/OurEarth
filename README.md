# OUR EARTH  
**Visualizing Atmospheric Energy | Tracking Noble Gases in Real Time**

---

## Overview

**Our Earth** is an advanced open-source initiative merging esoteric cosmology, atmospheric chemistry, and modern satellite data science. The platform uses **NASA EOSDIS** satellite data to visualize and track the real-time behavior of **noble gases** and their energetic derivatives across Earth's atmosphere in **4D** — space, time, frequency, and spiritual resonance.

At its core, Our Earth aims to reveal the unseen atmospheric interactions that shape life on Earth, offering interactive dashboards, a real-time globe engine, and predictive insights tied to both scientific and metaphysical frameworks.

## Key Features

### 1. **Live Satellite Data Integration**
- Pulls top-tier datasets from [NASA EOSDIS](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/)
- Focus on nine noble gases: **He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn, Og, Hs, and Fr (proxy)**
- Tracks both physical concentrations and energetic patterning

### 2. **Esoteric Atmospheric Modeling**
- Layered quantum fields inspired by ancient metaphysical geometry
- Custom symbolic overlays (e.g., Archangelic resonances, solar portals, ley lines)

### 3. **4D Visualization Engine**
- Built using **WebGL** and **Three.js**
- Rotating globe with interactive atmospheric overlays
- Time-loop feature to observe past, present, and projected future flows

### 4. **Real-Time Dashboard UI**
- Responsive design for desktop & mobile
- Filter by element, polarity (Yin/Yang), spiritual archetype
- Includes live telemetry feed + cosmic anomaly alerts
